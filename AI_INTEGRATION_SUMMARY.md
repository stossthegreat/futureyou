## 🔌 **Backend Integration**

### **API Endpoints**
```typescript
GET  /api/v1/coach/messages       // Fetch all briefs/nudges/debriefs
POST /api/v1/coach/messages/:id/read  // Mark as read
POST /api/v1/chat                 // Enhanced chat with context
```

### **Message Types**
1. **Morning Brief** - Daily orders (7am user timezone)
2. **Nudge** - Real-time drift correction
3. **Evening Debrief** - End of day reflection (9pm)
4. **Letter** - Deep reflective messages
5. **Mirror** - Self-reflection prompts

---

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **Morning Flow** (6am-10am)
1. User opens app
2. App checks for today's brief
3. If unread → Full-screen modal appears
4. User reads and dismisses
5. Saved to Inbox for later

### **Drift Detection** (All Day)
1. Backend monitors habit completion
2. Detects 6-hour drift (no completions)
3. Sends nudge via push notification
4. App shows orange banner on Home
5. User taps "Do it" → focuses on first undone habit

### **Evening Reflection** (8pm+)
1. User opens Mirror tab
2. Mirror shows today's score
3. Debrief text overlays mirror
4. "Tomorrow's focus" callout
5. Saved to Inbox history
