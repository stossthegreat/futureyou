## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP**

### Deploy Backend Changes to Railway

Your backend code has the new user controller, but **Railway still needs to pull the latest code**.

**Option 1: Auto-deploy (if enabled)**
- Railway will automatically detect the new commit and redeploy
- Wait ~2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
- Check Railway dashboard for "Deployed" status

**Option 2: Manual deploy**
```bash
# Go to Railway dashboard
# Click on your backend service
# Click "Deploy" → "Deploy Latest"
```

**Verify deployment:**
```bash
curl https://futureyou-production.up.railway.app/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-29T..."
}
```

## 📱 **TEST THE APP**

Once Railway is deployed, run:

```bash
cd /home/felix/futureyou
flutter run -d chrome
```

### Expected Behavior:

1. **✅ App launches** (no errors)
2. **✅ User auto-created** on first sync
   - Check logs: `👤 Ensuring user exists on backend...`
   - Should see: `✅ User created on backend: user_...`
3. **✅ Chat works** (send "Hello" → get AI response)
4. **✅ No more 500 errors** in console
5. **✅ All local features work** offline

## 🧪 **TESTING CHECKLIST**

### Basic Flow:
- [ ] Launch app (onboarding if first time)
- [ ] Create a habit
- [ ] Mark it complete → check sync logs
- [ ] Open Chat → send message → get AI response
- [ ] Check Inbox (top right) → no messages yet (backend needs to generate)
- [ ] Open Settings → verify user info

### AI Features (Will work once backend schedulers run):
- [ ] Morning Brief (generated at 7am your timezone)
- [ ] Evening Debrief (generated at 9pm)
- [ ] Nudges (when backend detects drift)
- [ ] Chat mentor (works immediately)

## 🐛 **IF SOMETHING BREAKS**

### Still getting 500 errors?
1. Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
2. Verify user controller deployed
3. Check PostgreSQL is connected

### Chat not responding?
1. Check OpenAI API key in Railway env vars
2. Check backend logs for errors
3. Try sending a simple message: "Hi"

### Messages not syncing?
1. Check network connection
2. Look for sync logs in Flutter console
3. Check backend `/api/v1/coach/messages` endpoint
