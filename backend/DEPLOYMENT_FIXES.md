# Railway Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Railway Configuration
- ✅ Created `railway.json` with proper build and deploy configuration
- ✅ Added `.railwayignore` to exclude unnecessary files

### 2. Dockerfile Issues
- ✅ Fixed Dockerfile to install ALL dependencies (including dev dependencies for build)
- ✅ Added proper EXPOSE directive for port 8080
- ✅ Ensured build process runs correctly

### 3. Package.json Build Script
- ✅ Simplified build script to `tsc && prisma generate`
- ✅ Removed problematic CI=false flag that was causing issues

### 4. Prisma Schema Issues
- ✅ Added missing `Task` model with all required fields
- ✅ Added missing `TodaySelection` model with proper relations
- ✅ Added missing `category` field to Task model
- ✅ Added proper relations between User, Habit, Task, and TodaySelection models

### 5. TypeScript Compilation Errors
- ✅ Fixed missing `getById` method in HabitsService
- ✅ Fixed import/export issues in services
- ✅ Removed non-existent fields from service methods
- ✅ Updated Prisma client generation

### 6. Environment Variable Handling
- ✅ Server already has proper environment validation that skips during build
- ✅ Health check endpoints are properly configured

## Files Modified

1. **railway.json** - Railway deployment configuration
2. **Dockerfile** - Fixed build process and dependencies
3. **package.json** - Simplified build script
4. **prisma/schema.prisma** - Added missing models and fields
5. **src/services/habits.service.ts** - Added getById method
6. **src/services/tasks.service.ts** - Fixed field references
7. **src/services/today.service.ts** - Fixed import issues
8. **.railwayignore** - Added to exclude unnecessary files

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables Required
Make sure these are set in your Railway dashboard:

```bash
# Database (Railway PostgreSQL addon will provide this)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Redis (Railway Redis addon will provide this)
REDIS_URL=redis://...

# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

# ElevenLabs Configuration
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_MARCUS=your_voice_id_here
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_DRILL=your_voice_id_here
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_CONFUCIUS=your_voice_id_here
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_LINCOLN=your_voice_id_here
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_BUDDHA=your_voice_id_here

# Firebase Configuration
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_firebase_client_email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_firebase_private_key

# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret

# S3 Configuration
S3_ENDPOINT=your_s3_endpoint
S3_BUCKET=your_s3_bucket_name
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your_s3_access_key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your_s3_secret_key

# Server Configuration
PORT=8080
HOST=0.0.0.0
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 2. Railway Services Required
- PostgreSQL database (Railway will provide DATABASE_URL)
- Redis instance (Railway will provide REDIS_URL)

### 3. Deployment Process
Railway will now:
1. Build the Docker image using the fixed Dockerfile
2. Install all dependencies (including dev dependencies for build)
3. Run TypeScript compilation (`npm run build`)
4. Generate Prisma client
5. Run database migrations (`npx prisma migrate deploy`)
6. Start the server (`node dist/server.js`)

### 4. Health Checks
- **Health Check**: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- **Startup Check**: `https://your-app.railway.app/startup-check`
- **API Docs**: `https://your-app.railway.app/docs`

## Testing Locally

The build process has been tested and works correctly:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run build
```

This will:
- Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- Generate Prisma client
- Create the `dist/` directory with all compiled files

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to Railway using the fixed configuration
2. Set all required environment variables in Railway dashboard
3. Add PostgreSQL and Redis services in Railway
4. Monitor deployment logs for any issues
5. Test the health check endpoints after deployment

The backend should now deploy successfully on Railway!
